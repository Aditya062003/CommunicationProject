## Project Description:
This project involves the use of two Arduino Uno boards, designated as the transmitter and receiver, to transmit and receive signals. The circuit design was initially simulated using the online platform TinkerCad, and later implemented physically using long wires instead of resistors. The experiment was conducted with two laptops and two Arduino boards.

For signal generation, the `digitalWrite` functions in Arduino were utilized to create the input pulse train. On the receiving end, the `analogRead` function was employed to measure the voltage of the received signal.

### Online Simulation:
The preliminary design and testing were performed in the TinkerCad online simulator. The simulation link is [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ihNba3Csmhe-sizzling-crift-amur/editel?sharecode=IL2ZjtdGiuHfR_8eh3qfWRBehl1jZMXm2J_omQIxM04).

### Offline Experiment:
The physical experiment was carried out, and the results were captured in videos. The experiment involved measuring the output using an oscilloscope. Two videos showcase the offline experiment:
